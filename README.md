#  Rock vs Mine Prediction using Logistic Regression ‚õè

Welcome to the **Rock vs Mine Prediction** project!  
This is a binary classification machine learning project that predicts whether a sonar signal reflects off a **rock** or a **mine** using the **Logistic Regression** algorithm ‚Äî one of the simplest yet most powerful classification tools.

## üöÄ Project Overview

In this project, we aim to classify sonar signals as either reflecting off a **rock** ü™® or a **mine** üí£.  
We use **Logistic Regression**, a supervised learning algorithm that's ideal for binary classification problems.

Each data point represents a sonar signal captured across multiple frequencies. The idea is to train a model that can learn the patterns from these frequencies and predict the correct category.

## üìÇ Dataset

- **Source:** [Kaggle - Sonar Rock vs Mine Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sonar-all-data)
- **Instances:** 208
- **Features:** 60 continuous numeric attributes representing sonar frequency response
- **Target Labels:**
  - `R` ‚Üí Rock
  - `M` ‚Üí Mine

> üöß The dataset is balanced and does **not** require extra resampling techniques.

## üîç Objective

Build an accurate machine learning model that classifies unknown sonar readings into one of two categories:

- ü™® **Rock**
- üí£ **Mine**

This classification problem is a real-world application in the fields of underwater object detection and military defense systems.

## üß† Machine Learning Approach

- **Algorithm Used:** Logistic Regression
- **Why Logistic Regression?**  
  Logistic Regression is widely used for binary classification due to its simplicity, interpretability, and strong mathematical foundation. It provides probability scores and decision boundaries ideal for two-class problems like this.
